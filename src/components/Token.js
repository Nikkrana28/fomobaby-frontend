                      FOMO BABY is a token on Binance Smart Chain with unique rebasing mechanism. <br />

                      Fomo Baby Devs have been hearing the community demands and decided to launch an all in 1 contract that will 
                      fulfill the community incentives and needs. From Staking , NFTâ€™S , Buy Back system , Weekly lottos and of course  
                      our rebasing mechanism this Project will be Flawless.  Fomo Baby was created to keep a reliable price in a volatile 
                      market. Strategically designed and judiciously used to increase the price with a smart mathematical rebasing feature 
                      implemented in the contract. This smart feature will allow the charts to constantly stay green and cause new 
                      investors to Fomo in due to the major incline in price.
