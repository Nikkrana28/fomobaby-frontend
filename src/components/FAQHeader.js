      question: "What is Rebase?",
      answer:
        "The rebasing mechanism adjusts the token circulating supply periodically. Letâ€™s say we have an elastic supply token that aims to achieve a value of 1 USD. If the price is below 1 USD, the rebase reduces the current supply, increasing the value of each token. This is known as a negative rebase. ",

      question: "Why is my $FOMOBABY token balance reducing?",
      answer:
        "The rebasing mechanism adjusts the token circulating supply periodically. With each negative rebase the balance will go down along with total supply in the same ratio. Say you had 2 tokens at $1 each and there are 100 tokens in existence, then market cap is $100 and you own 2%. After rebase, there are 50 tokens and you own 1, but price is $2. You still own $2 worth of tokens, you still own 2%. If marketcap rises to $200 you have 2x your investment. ",

      question: "What is happening with the chart?",
      answer:
        "Due to the nature of the protocol, the price of the coin rebases every 8 hours to the pegged price. If you are holding $FOMOBABY token in your wallet, you will notice them fluctuating after a rebase. The protocol is designed for token supply to change without the holders having to do anything. ",
